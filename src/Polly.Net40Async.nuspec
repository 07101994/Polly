     Polly.Net40Async is a version of the Polly library specifically for for .NET 4.0 with async support via Microsoft.Bcl.Async.  Allows developers to express transient exception and fault handling policies such as Retry, Retry Forever, Wait and Retry or Circuit Breaker in a fluent manner.

    <releaseNotes>
     5.0.0
     ---------------------
     A major release, adding significant new resilience policies:
     - Timeout policy: allows timing out any execution (for both co-operative and unco-operative underlying delegates)
     - Bulkhead isolation policy: limits the resources consumable by governed actions, such that a faulting channel cannot cause cascading failures, also bringing down other operations.
     - Fallback policy: provides for a fallback execution or substitute value, in case of overall failure
     - PolicyWrap: allows flexibly combining any Policy instances in the Polly armoury, to form an overall resilience strategy.

     Other changes include:
     - Add PolicyKeys and context to all policy executions, as bedrock for forthcoming introduction of policy events and metrics tracking executions. 
     - Add CancellationToken support to synchronous executions (to support TimeoutPolicy).
     - Add some missing ExecuteAndCapture/Async overloads. 
     - Provide .NET4.0 support uniquely through Polly.NET40Async package
     - Retire ContextualPolicy (not part of documented API; support now in Policy base class)
     - Discontinue .NET3.5 support

      4.3.0
      ---------------------
      - Added ability for policies to handle return results.  Optimised circuit-breaker hot path.  Fixed circuit-breaker threshold bug.  

      4.2.4
      ---------------------
      - Added overloads to WaitAndRetry and WaitAndRetryAsync methods that accept an onRetry delegate which includes the attempt count.

      4.2.3
      ---------------------
      - Cleaned up new Polly.Net40Async NuGet package, removing Polly.dll and unused framework folders.

      4.2.2
      ---------------------
      - Add new Polly.Net40Async project supporting async for .NET40 via Microsoft.Bcl.Async.  This is available as separate Nuget packages Polly.Net40Async and Polly.Net40Async-signed.
